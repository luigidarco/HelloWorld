## My Carrer Passions
I like computers since I got one in the early 2000, I like to work with clients helping them to find a solution for problems and give the appropriate tools. When I see a software, I think in simplicity and efficency for all. (redo work is not cool!)   

## My Hobbies. 
In my free time, i like to jog around the city, read the Bible, comic books like Spiderman, play the classic Mario Bros, Sonic and Megaman on console. My priority is family, I would do anything for them.
